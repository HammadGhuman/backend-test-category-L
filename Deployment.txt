in order to deploy the application 

First we should optimize the application by 

1. optimizing the code 
2. implement caching
3. implement logging
etc 

for the high scalability of the app we can use docker and 
kubernetes by setting up scaling polices to adjust the 
number of instance based on load

set of configService and env to easily setup the environment
variables make sure to store the sensitive information in the 
env files 

implement a testing service 

implement a robust CI CD pipeline

we can use any cloud service providers to deploy the application

we can also use nginx for load balancing
